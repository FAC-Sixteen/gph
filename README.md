### Built with

* Node
* Tape
* Supertest
* PostgreSQL
* Our guinea pig hotelier dreams

## Goals

- [x] TDD server tested with supertest
- [x] Test database tested with tape
- [ ] Keep it secure!
- [ ] Mobile-responsive
- [x] Host on Heroku
- [ ] Accessible!
### Features
- [ ] Check in a guinea pig with POST method
- [ ] Receive confirmation of check-in
- [ ] Check out a guinea pig (also with POST method)
- [ ] Database of individual guinea pigs and rooms

### Stretch
- [ ] Display current guest data in the DOM
- [ ] Populate check in with relevant data

## Hurdles (issues)
![hurdles](https://media.giphy.com/media/6whrgZbPXGJwrhwMAz/giphy.gif)
* Less time than normal
* Little real understanding of setting up the database & testing it
* Understanding data types & linking primary & foreign keys
* true/false (bit) in sql
* so.many.callbacks.

## Cool stuff we learned
